      Connection is a proxy class for managing connection to the speech service
      of the specified Recognizer.

      By default, a Recognizer autonomously manages connection to service when
      needed.

      The Connection class provides additional methods for users to explicitly
      open or close a connection and

      to subscribe to connection status changes.

      The use of Connection is optional, and mainly for scenarios where fine
      tuning of application

      behavior based on connection status is needed. Users can optionally call
      Open() to manually set up a connection

      in advance before starting recognition on the Recognizer associated with
      this Connection.

      If the Recognizer needs to connect or disconnect to service, it will

      setup or shutdown the connection independently. In this case the
      Connection will be notified by change of connection

      status via Connected/Disconnected events.

      Added in version 1.2.0.
