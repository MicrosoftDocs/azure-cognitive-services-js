summary: >-
  Connection is a proxy class for managing connection to the speech service of
  the specified Recognizer.

  By default, a Recognizer autonomously manages connection to service when
  needed.

  The Connection class provides additional methods for users to explicitly open
  or close a connection and

  to subscribe to connection status changes.

  The use of Connection is optional, and mainly for scenarios where fine tuning
  of application

  behavior based on connection status is needed. Users can optionally call
  Open() to manually set up a connection

  in advance before starting recognition on the Recognizer associated with this
  Connection.

  If the Recognizer needs to connect or disconnect to service, it will

  setup or shutdown the connection independently. In this case the Connection
  will be notified by change of connection

  status via Connected/Disconnected events.

  Added in version 1.2.1.
